# Overtime_Compute
The purpose of this Python package compute_overtime is to simplify the task of calculating the amount of overtime accrued over a period whilst undertaking a particular task or job.

- c_{t-1}  - cell state at the previous time step
- $$c_{t}$$      - cell state (i.e. hidden state $h_{t}$ at time *t* or long-term memory)
- $h_{t-1}$ - hidden state at the previous time step
- $h_{t}$   - hidden state at time *t* calculated from value of hidden state $h_{t-1}$ 
- $x_{t}$   - input vector to the LSTM unit.
